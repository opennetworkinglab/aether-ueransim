# ueransim

This blueprint runs UERANSIM in place of gNBsim, providing a second way to direct workload at SD-Core. Of particular note, UERANSIM runs iperf3, making it possible to measure UPF throughput. (In contrast, gNBsim primarily stresses the Core's Control Plane.)

The UERANSIM blueprint includes the following:

Global vars file "vars/main-ueransim.yml" gives the overall blueprint specification.

## Step-by-Step Installation
To install ueransim, follow these steps:
1. Inventory file hosts.ini needs to be modified to identify the server that is to run UERANSIM. Currently, a second server is needed, as UERANSIM and SD-Core cannot be deployed on the same server.
"[ueransim_nodes]
node2"
2. Install the UERANSIM
   - Update the config files under configs directory for both UE and gNB. 
   - Run "make aether-ueransim-install".
3. Start the simulation
   - Set "amf.ip" to the IP address of the core machine.
   - Run "make aether-ueransim-run".

### One-Step Installation
To install ueransim in one go, run `make aether-ueransim-install`.

### Uninstall
To uninstall ueransim, run `make aether-ueransim-uninstall`.
